# List of Reasons to Move to the US

1. U.S. industry loves profiteering from tragedy and loss. These actions that many people think are morally questionable are in actuality part of the agenda of optimization and 
   efficiency (cutting the losses, shortselling, misleading advertisement, layoffs).
2. There has been a rich tradition of hyphenated-Americans in many prestigious positions ever since the emancipation of 1865. Although the loyalties of hyphenated-Americans are 
   usually questioned during economic and national downturns, this demographic tends to drive the innovation engine of the nation (at least according to the face of U.S. capitalism)
   as well as the financial markets. 
4.  The U.S. is a deeply classist nation, a feature made evident by the conservative forces that govern a predominant number of regions (including democratic cities). 
    Classism is made so evident by the barriers constructed by those in charge, so that the exceptions that pass through those barriers are usually called "miraculous".
    Another example is U.S. industry, which is very calculating because of its requirement of profits.
6. Due to the historic unreliability of the labor market in the U.S., the chances that a rich immigrant to the U.S. will have a higher quality of life based on their possessions is
   exponentially higher than poor native-born citizens.
7. Many would say the U.S. is more of an aristocracy than a meritocracy.
8. Despite the U.S. affinity for efficiency and optimization in its processes, its anti-democratic spirit ensures that there will always be maladaptions and inefficiencies due
   to misunderstandings perpetuated through the media machine. These maladaptions and inefficiencies manifest themselves in ways that extend beyond ethnicity, gender, faith, and
   background.
9. Many of the newer generation of immigrants to the U.S. do not have a Western European background, or even influence from Western Europe.
10. The U.S. media machine is very extensive and a multi-national tool of influence.
11. Many businesses in the U.S. are small businesses, and those are predominantly family-oriented.
12. Freedom of religion has to contend with the capitalist spirit of the U.S., that which enjoys expensive science and conducts commerce with many nations near or far. 
13. People read the U.S. headlines and see the statistics, prompting them to expect a lot for themselves from the U.S.
14. The U.S. has been going through indescribable political changes over the past two decades.
15. The U.S. media and other social figures use a very inclusive and psychodramatik way of talking about diversity, the corporate ladder, and political power.
16. Some terms associated with the U.S.' competitive spirit are `rat race`, `scramble`, `hustle`, and `ambition`.
17. The regionalism of the U.S. ensures that some regions are favored to hold economic hegemonies over certain industries than others.
